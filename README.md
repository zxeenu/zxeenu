# Hi there, I'm zxeenu! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

I am a passionate developer focused on building efficient, scalable, and user-friendly software. 
I care deeply about correctness, clarity, and ergonomics—both for users and future maintainers. 

I currently design and maintain a dynamic workflow orchestration system, where these principles 
are tested daily against real-world complexity.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🌱 I like TypeScript.
- 💥 I like errors and exceptions that clearly tell you what to fix.
- 🧠 I like software designs that guide you toward the correct solution by default

## 🛠️ My Methodology 

A well-designed system doesn't just work. It makes incorrect usage impossible or intolerable. 

- 🛡️ Guard first
- 🏃‍♂️ Return early
- 🧠 Keep the logic fearless
- 🚨 Let exceptions be loud

I value designs where:

- errors are explicit
- edge cases are uncomfortable to ignore
- intent is obvious from types and structure (I’d go so far as to say types are part of the developer documentation)

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools

- **Languages:** TypeScript, Python, Go  
- **Frameworks & Tools:** Laravel, React, Remix, Mantine, Prisma  
- **DevOps:** Docker, Docker Compose, Caddy  
- **Other Interests:** distributed architectures, event-based systems, message brokers, observability, reactive programming, probabilistic data structures (will I ever have a chance where I will need to use one?)
